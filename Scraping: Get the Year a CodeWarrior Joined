#Task: Write a function get_member_since which accepts a username from someone at Codewars and 
returns an string containing the month and year separated by a space that they joined CodeWars.

###If you want/don't want your username to be in the tests, ask me in the discourse area. 
There can't be too many though because the server may time out.

#Example:

>>> get_member_since('dpleshkov')
Jul 2016
>>> get_member_since('jhoffner')
Oct 2012


solution:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_member_since(username):
    # Your magic here :)
    url = 'https://www.codewars.com/users/'+username
    res=requests.get(url).text
    soup=BeautifulSoup(res, 'html.parser')
    start_date=soup.find_all(class_='stat')
    for item in start_date:
        if item.text.startswith('Member Since:'):
            return item.text.split(":")[-1]
